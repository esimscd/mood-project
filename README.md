# Mood selector web app
This web app allows users to select a mood, dynamically changing the background colour and embedding a matching playlist.

**Features**
* Dynamic Backgrounds – Changes colour based on the selected mood and uses a fun moving gradient effect between two colours for each mood
* Embedded Playlists – Displays a Spotify playlist for each mood linked directly from Spotify using an iframe
* Simple & Lightweight – Built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).

**How it works**

User selects a mood from the drop down and the background colour and plalist update to match the mood.
